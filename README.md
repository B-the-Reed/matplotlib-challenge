# matplotlib-challenge

This repository contains my Matplotlib Challenge submission for Module 5 of the UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp. 

- Open the pymaceutical_BRR_vFinal.ipynb file to review the code for the assignment. 
- The data sources for the assignment are found in the data folder. The source of the data is https://mockaroo.com/ (2022). 
- I worked through part of the code for the for loop with a TA during a tutoring session. I also reviewed some elements of my code in the assignment with fellow students in study sessions.
